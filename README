 nlcc
======
use any of the NIST lightweight crypto algorithm entries as a CLI tool

 deps
------
* libsodium
* api.h, encrypt.c from an algorithm's source

 building
----------
* copy api.h, and encrypt.c from your chosen algorithm's source to the repo
  root
* run `make`

 usage
-------
nlcc [-h] [-k key_file] [-n nonce_file] [-a ad] [-m message|-d ciphertext]
where:
    -h               shows help
    -k key_file      file to read key from
    -n nonce_file    file to read nonce from
    -a ad            string of associated data
    -m message       message to encrypt
    -d ciphertext    ciphertext to decrypt

 todo
