 nlcc
======
use any of the NIST lightweight crypto algorithm entries as a CLI tool

 warning
---------
! this tool can be accurately described as a 'toy'
! it is not designed to be secure
! do not use this for securing any sensitive information

 deps
------
* libsodium
* api.h, encrypt.c from an algorithm's source

 building
----------
* copy api.h, and encrypt.c from your chosen algorithm's source to the repo
  root
* run `make`

 usage
-------
nlcc [-h] [-k key_file] [-n nonce_file] [-a ad] [-m message|-d ciphertext]
where:
    -h               shows help
    -k key_file      file to read key from
    -n nonce_file    file to read nonce from
    -a ad            string of associated data
    -m message       message to encrypt
    -d ciphertext    ciphertext hex digest to decrypt

* outputs are hex encoded and are tailed with the output size (in bits)
* plaintext contains a decoded representation in quotations
* example output:
      $ ./nlcc -k ./file -m "testing message" -a "adadadadad"
      Key   = ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff (128)
      Nonce = 000000000000000000000000 (96)
      AD    = 61646164616461646164 (80)
      PT    = 74657374696e67206d657373616765 ("testing message") (120)
      CT    = 87e649bf2c3e6c83cbb1ee7120c419a1f58b03b0386258

 todo
------
* encrypt/decrypt from stdin/stdout
* load associated data from file
* better command-line flags
* script to download and compile every competition entry into a CLI tool
